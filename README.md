# heap-priority-queue
Context:
<br />-To build a system that allows hospital patients with their uniquely assigned
health and illness
<br />-Each time 2 patients are taken out of the system to be treated, 1 unit of time
will pass and the health will be updated.
<br />-Any additions to patients should be sorted into the queue immediately, with
time taken to be t = 0.

Objective:
<br />-To build a priority queue ADT using a heap data structure. A heap DS is chosen
because of its most ideal worse-case complexities of the operations required in
the context given.
<br />-Allow inputs to be added into priority queue
<br />-Allow retrieval of top priority items
